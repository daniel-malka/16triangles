# 16 Triangles

Welcome to the 16 Triangles project! This program generates unique triangle drawings based on a random number. It offers over 2,000 possible options for every 40 by 40 pixels, allowing for a wide range of artistic possibilities.

## Introduction

The purpose of this program is to provide a fun and creative way to generate triangle art. By leveraging random number generation and customizable settings, users can create unique and visually appealing triangle compositions.

## Features

- Random Triangle Generation: The program generates triangles based on a random number, ensuring that each drawing is unique and unpredictable.
- Customization Options: The program allows users to customize various aspects of the triangle art, such as the size, congestion, and color of the triangles. This provides flexibility and control over the generated artwork.
- User Interface (UI) Development: We are currently developing a user interface that will provide an intuitive way to interact with the program and customize the triangle settings. This UI will enhance the user experience and make the program more accessible.
- Saving and Downloading Art Pieces: Users can save their favorite triangle art pieces to their devices and download them as image files. This feature enables users to preserve and share their creations with others.
- Sharing with Friends: The program allows users to easily share their favorite triangle art pieces with friends. Sharing options may include social media integration or direct sharing via email or messaging platforms.

- Advanced Customization Options: We aim to expand the customization options to include more parameters such as rotation, transparency, and pattern variations. This will allow users to create even more diverse and intricate triangle art.
- Community Gallery: We plan to introduce a community gallery where users can showcase their artwork and explore creations made by other artists. This will foster a sense of community and inspiration among users.
- Additional Export Formats: In addition to image files, we are exploring options to export triangle art in other formats such as vector graphics, allowing for scaling and editing without loss of quality.
